<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early body composition analysis in patients with liver cirrhosis is important for correcting malnutrition and improving prognosis and quality of life. Severe muscle wasting or Sarcopenia is the most common and often undetected complication, with serious negative effects on survival and quality of life. The purpose of this study was to use deep learning methods to segment and quantify body composition, and to determine Skeletal muscle reduced Visceral Obesity ( SVO ) by Skeletal Muscle Index ( SMI ) and Visceral to Subcutaneous adipose tissue Ratio ( VSR ) to examine its relationship with survival in patients with cirrhosis. In this paper, a new segmentation framework MCAUnet based on deep learning is proposed. The framework adds an attention mechanism from the perspective of the channel, which can adaptively fuse enough channel features to facilitate complex medical image segmentation. Compared with the previous segmentation model, the effect is optimal ( Dice &#x3D; 0.952 ). We analyzed 117 adult patients with cirrhosis who were admitted to Shanxi Bethune Hospital between January 2016 and December 2020. SOV was defined as Sarcopenia ( male SMI &lt;43.24 cm2 &#x2F; m2, female SMI &lt; 35.11 cm2 &#x2F; m2 ) and visceral obesity ( male VSR ≥ 1.07, female VSR ≥0.68 ). 18.8 % of the subjects met the SOV criteria. Through survival analysis, the 3-year and 5-year survival rates of SVO patients were significantly lower than those of normal patients ( 32 % VS50 %, 5 % VS32 % ) [ P &#x3D; 0.035 ]. In regression analysis, SVO was associated with mortality in patients with cirrhosis ( hazard ratio 0.54,95 % confidence interval 0.3-0.97 ), and still significant after multiple regression analysis ( hazard ratio 0.62,95 % confidence interval 0.31-1.3 ). Overall, SVO is associated with reduced survival in patients with cirrhosis, and further prospective studies and studies in other populations are needed to evaluate the model and the actual predictive effect of SVO.</p>

<p>Cirrhosis, Body Composition, Skeletal muscle reduced Visceral Obesity</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, this study shows that the presence of L3 layer SVO determined by CT images of patients with cirrhosis can be used to predict OS in patients with cirrhosis. Furthermore, compared with other criteria used in previous studies ( MELD score and total body fat content ), the use of SVO to distinguish patients has higher reliability in predicting the overall survival of patients with cirrhosis. Surgeons should therefore pay more attention to the presence of patients with sarcopenic visceral obesity, which can help to personalize nutritional therapy promptly, reduce postoperative complications and improve the long-term prognosis of patients.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently, there are over one million organ transplant recipients worldwide, with nearly 300,000 of them having received kidney transplants. In China, the number of kidney transplant recipients is close to 30,000. Kidney transplant involves transplanting a healthy kidney from a donor to a patient who has kidney disease and has lost kidney function. The human body has two kidneys, and when both kidneys lose function (bilateral kidney failure), kidney transplant is the most ideal treatment method.</p>
<p><strong>eGFR</strong> (estimated glomerular filtration rate) is an internationally recognized indicator that can effectively reflect the filtering function of the kidneys. A higher eGFR value indicates better kidney function. It is an important criterion for determining whether postoperative patients have abnormal kidney function.</p>

<p><strong>Current Research Pain Point 1:</strong></p>
<p>In terms of statistics, the use of generalized linear models to study variables is limited by covariance and collinearity, which can be explained but the results are not satisfactory.</p>
<p><strong>Current Research Pain Point 2:</strong></p>
<p>In terms of machine learning, the analysis of features is simple and relies on models, without in-depth exploration of data.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Ideas:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use machine learning models to break free from linear constraints and study features.</li>
<li>Return to linear models for statistical interpretation.</li>
<li>Study data without relying on models.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My Reselt:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Obtained important factors that affect kidney transplant outcomes, constructed and selected 10 indicators. Two were existing original data (but overlooked by doctors) and eight were constructed as temporal features. <strong>The model is simple, and all features passed statistical tests, making the model highly interpretable.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Quantified the indicators.</strong> Defined a formula to calculate the risk index and defined the risk index S to quantify the risk of postoperative recurrence.</li>
<li><strong>Interpreted the clinical significance of the risk index.</strong> Studied the real-world significance of the gradient based on the defined formula and evaluated and optimized the calculation of the existing GFR formula.</li>
<li><strong>Validated the conclusion.</strong> Calculated the risk index for all patients in the existing dataset of 345 and compared it with their original classification labels, demonstrating the role and significance of the risk index.</li>

<p><strong>Meaning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By calculating the risk coefficient S, the GFR value can be optimized to reduce misjudgment, and the calculated risk coefficient S can be used to determine the risk trend.</li>
